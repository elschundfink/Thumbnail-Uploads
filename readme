Thumbnail Upload is a simple HTML5 drag and drop thumbnail upload plugin to replace the default created thumbnails with your own thumbnails.

== Description ==

Thumbnail Uploads is a simple HTML5 and javascript based drag and drop image upload plugin. It allows to replace the thumbnails that are auto generated by the default image resizer of wordpress. You can just drag the images from your desktop or any other location and replace them with the incorrect thumbnails which are automatically generated by the wordpress media manager.


When to use this plugin?

If you want your own thumbnail to be displayed in the photo galleries instead of the default created by wordpress. For example if the thumbnail of your photo gallery does not look good or if you are not satisfied by the thumbnail created by wordpress. Then you can upload your own thumbnails and replace them with the ones already created by wordpress.

How it works?

You can drag and drop the thumbnails that you want to replace using the simple interface provided by the plugin. Two things you must take care while uploading the images is the size of the image and also the name of the image.
 1. The actual size of the image you created and the size you specified in the plugin must be the same.
 2. The filename of the image must be same as the original fullsize image that you uploaded in the media gallery.
 
Since this plugin works by replacement of the image, this means the original fullsize image must be available in the server and the filename of the image that you are about to upload also must be same as the original image.

For Example:

if you have a image 'myfile.jpg' to upload to the gallery. First you upload it to your media gallery and see if the default thumbnail is correct or not.
If it is not correct you can create your own thumbnail (the size does not matter) of 'myfile.jpg' and rename it as 'myfile.jpg' and upload by dragging on the drag zone of the plugin. Also don't forget to enter the actual size (hight and width) of the thumbnail on the two input fields. This size must be exactly the same to the size of the thumbnail you want to replace with.

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
